# Output Data

This directory contains experimental artifacts generated by the controller benchmarking scripts.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains CSV files with raw trajectory tracking data.
- `plots/`: Contains PNG plots visualizing controller performance.

## Governance
- **Git Ignore**: All data CSVs and plot PNGs are ignored by git to prevent repository bloat.
- **Regenerability**: All files in this directory should be considered ephemeral and reproducible by running the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
